# Choosing an ADR Type

## Context
The different decisions being made throughout this process needs to be documented in an organised manner.

## Decision
The lightweight ADR will be used over the MADR.

The [architecture-decision-record repositry by joelparkerhenderson](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record#file-name-conventions-for-adrs), using the [template made by Michael Nygard](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record#file-name-conventions-for-adrs) to record all decisions.

## Consequences
- Will make documenting decisions easier
- Will increase documentation organisation
- Will be able to keep track of decisions made

## Status
Accepted
