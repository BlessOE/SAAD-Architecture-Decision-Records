# Data from external systems

## Context
Some of the data being used in this system will come from existing systems.

## Decision
Instead of redesigning the whole system again, the main functionality from the visa processing system storing all of the users login details and providing it's functionalities will be used within the system.

## Consequences
- There is a possibility we might run into some compatability issues when integrating the different system
- More time can be spent of developing and designing the main system that is stated in the given case study/brief

## Status
Accepted
