# Chosen payment processing method

## Context
How the user payments will be processed within the system

## Decision
This system will use a PSP (payment service provider) such as paypal and stripe to process the payments over building a payment service from scratch.

We would have to look into building a payment service specifically for this system due to the demand of visa applications

## Consequences
- Less time consuming
- High demand may prove less cost effective in the long run

## Status
Accepted
